# This is my Voice Assistant Project while I was an Intern at Lets Grow More

⭐ Task 04 Python project: Voice Assistant while I was an Intern at [LetsGrowMore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahajanrohan03/recent-activity/all/#) ! 🎙️🤖

🔍 Project Overview: I've developed an interactive voice assistant application using Python, designed to understand and respond to voice commands. The assistant can learn new information, recall stored data, and provide responses based on the user's queries.

✨ Key Features:

✪ Voice Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to accurately capture and process spoken input.

✪ Text-to-Speech: Implements pyttsx3 to convert text responses into natural-sounding speech.

✪ Learning Capability: The assistant can learn new questions and answers, storing them for future interactions.

✪ Closest Match Suggestion: Uses the difflib module to find the closest match for unknown queries, offering helpful suggestions.

✪ Real-time Interaction: Engages in a continuous conversation, allowing users to interact seamlessly.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

✪ Python: The core programming language powering the application.

✪ Speech Recognition (speech_recognition): For capturing and processing voice input.

✪ Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3): To convert text responses into speech.

✪ Difflib: For finding the closest match to unknown queries.
